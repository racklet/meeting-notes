## Biweekly Recap

### Daniel

- oreboot can run barebox just fine
    - Plus, it runs both in QEMU and [RVVM](https://mastodon.social/@CyReVolt/113971038824718149)
- Got the [platform timer on the K230 to work](https://mastodon.social/@CyReVolt/113991917309418454)
    - Needed to set a bit in a debug register that is not remotely documented to be related AFAICT, someone else found it in vendor U-Boot code
- Got SG2002 DRAM init to work, with a little hardcoding hack
    - Auto detection needs some fixing somewhere, complicated
    - [SBI test with timer works](https://mastodon.social/@CyReVolt/114021889908485034) as well
- WIP libraries for oreboot
    - Architecture specific helpers for XuanTie platforms
    - Utilities for MMIO access dropping the `unsafe`
    - Memory test

### Dennis

- Still fighting with Ceph head latency in the x86 test cluster, will probably need to open an issue to get more insights from the experts
- The [Sipeed NanoCluster](https://x.com/SipeedIO/status/1887709604349399413) looks very interesting for Racklet
    - 7 SOMs in a Raspberry Pi form factor
    - Each SOM with up to [4x Cortex-A76 or 8x Cortex-A55](https://x.com/SipeedIO/status/1891338072656089259) sounds *very* interesting, better than Pi 5 performance (if cooled properly)
        - Up to 448 cores in an 8 compute module 2U Racklet tray!
    - Gigabit "trunk" from the SOM carrier might be limiting
    - RAM amount per SOM is the final decider, hopefully at least 2 GiB per core

## Discussions

We had another look at Arm, its SMM equivalent, discussed how x86 SMM and RISC-V M-mode are similar, and came across

- ![Trusted boot flow on Arm](https://community.arm.com/resized-image/__size/2080x0/__key/communityserver-blogs-components-weblogfiles/00-00-00-37-98/7802.Figure-1.png)

We also discussed DTB shenanigans, see

## Biweekly Recap

### Dennis

- Debugging Ceph performance on the x86 test cluster
    - Very fast read IOPS and decently fast write IOPS
    - The MDS (file creations/deletions etc.) is for some reason limited to only around 15 files/second, which is very slow
    - The MDS journal is probably the culprit, have yet to dig into the profiling details
- Kernel 6.14 has support for C906 vector extension (0.7) [errata](https://www.phoronix.com/news/Linux-6.14-RISC-V)

### Daniel

- Was at FOSDEM, including 2 OSFW hack days
    - Ported [DRAM init for K230D to oreboot](https://github.com/oreboot/oreboot/pull/764)
    - Extended [`kendryte_boot`](https://github.com/orangecms/kendryte_boot) so you can load additional code to RAM
    - Added `main` stage in oreboot and dummy SBI
    - Simple [SBI print test works](https://mastodon.social/@CyReVolt/113930859208849486)
    - Currently debugging mtimer, `mtime` is stuck at `0`

## Biweekly Recap

### Dennis

- Daniel hinted at the newly established [mini rack project](https://mini-rack.jeffgeerling.com/) from Jeff Geerling
    - Uses the same 10" rack form factor as Racklet
    - 3D-printed plates to mount Pi's etc.
    - Other useful shelves/mounts listed there as well
    - Power delivery is a challenge â€“ as we've already discovered with Racklet
        - PDU discussion [here](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues/5)
        - UPS discussion [here](https://github.com/geerlingguy/mini-rack/issues/1)
        - These are mostly 110/230 V though, nothing yet for USB-C PD etc.
    - Network switch lists are useful for Racklet
        - Looking forward to the community discovering powerful-enough PoE switches for multiple nodes
    - Software/firmware side severely lacking though:
        - No firmware security/boot integrity/Open Compute -level secure boot
        - Very basic (mutable) Kubernetes setups only
    - TL;DR: Useful for sourcing parts for the Racklet hardware side, though we want more density and better firmware security + actual Open Compute -level software (immutable Kubernetes)
- Achieved over 14k 4K direct random read QD2 IOPS with Ceph on the x86 test cluster! :chart_with_upwards_trend:
    - In layman's terms: distributed filesystems can be made very snappy at a small scale as well
    - This proves the viability of Ceph on lower-end hardware, SBCs such as the Rock 5B should not have any issues running this stack
    - 8 GiB of RAM, 4 threads and Gigabit ethernet is sufficient

### Daniel

- Made lots of progress on the BL808
    - Got the loader tool to the point where it can load any binary for any core to run immediately
    - Got [PSRAM working](https://mastodon.social/@CyReVolt/113852399724541310)
    - Did another [dev live stream on it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCvZkpvgpm0)

## Additional notes

We took a closer look at the RISC-V SBI, including the Hart State Management extension and specifically RustSBI, some projects using RustSBI, and how global singletons are initialized in them.

## Biweekly Recap

### Daniel

- More thorough test of the TH1520 showed its DRAM wasn't really working
- Got back on the Bouffalo Lab BL808
    - Started a [loader tool](https://github.com/orangecms/bl_boot) as usual
        - Slowly figuring out how the boot process and the many efuse bits work
    - Lots of [open resources from the community](https://github.com/openbouffalo/) and [the vendor](https://github.com/bouffalolab/)
- 38C3 was a blast :tada: - blog post on OSFF website coming soon:tm:
    - We bootstrapped the Canaan K230 SoC during a workshop
    - Reversed its mask ROM in a previous one (got started)

### Dennis

- More work on the x86 Racklet software architecture test cluster
    - Ceph (distributed storage) is now running very well
    - Encountered some bugs in Cilium (networking)
    - Talos Linux has an [annoying bug](https://github.com/siderolabs/talos/pull/10060) that prevents upgrades right now
- Taught myself KiCad over the holidays, received first PCB from JLC
- Haven't yet gotten into messing with the RISC-V ESP32C6
- Explored Linux real-time scheduling on a Raspberry Pi 3
    - `threadirqs` is very useful for multicore embedded systems
